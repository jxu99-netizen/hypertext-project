<h1>If I Were Not an International Student</h1>
<h3>by Jiarui Xu</h3>

<p>I wake up to the sound of traffic outside my dorm.<br>
<span class="hidden">If I had stayed home, maybe I would still hear my mother calling me for breakfast.</span></p>

<p>I walk through a campus full of strangers.<br>
<span class="hidden">At home, I would have known every corner, every name, every tree that bloomed in spring.</span></p>

<p>People ask me where I’m from.<br>
<span class="hidden">Sometimes I wonder if I still belong anywhere.</span></p>

<p>I speak carefully, shaping every word to sound right.<br>
<span class="hidden">But the language that used to feel natural now hides behind my tongue.</span></p>

<p>I send messages across time zones.<br>
<span class="hidden">If I were home, I could just walk downstairs and knock on a friend’s door.</span></p>

<p>They say studying abroad is freedom.<br>
<span class="hidden">But freedom often feels like distance in disguise.</span></p>

<p>At night, I look out at the city lights.<br>
<span class="hidden">And I wonder if the person who never left home is looking at the same sky.</span></p>
